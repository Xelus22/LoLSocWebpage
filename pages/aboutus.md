Welcome to the University of New South Wales League of Legends Society!

Established in 2012 by a group of League friends, UNSW LoLSoc is home to enthusiasts, casual and competitive players of one of the most popular PC games in the world - League of Legends.

The spirit of our society aims to reflect the spirit of the game itself. Each year, our casual and competitive events bring like-minded gamers together. From various events like coaching and Friendly Fridays, to internal and external competitions like Uni Rumble and Sydney Battlegrounds; UNSW LoLSoc provides pathways for you to improve your gameplay, meet similar people, and to test your skills.

UNSW LoLSoc has grown to become a family for all of its members and supporters. We welcome new members with open arms and promise that once you join our family, you will never want to look back.
