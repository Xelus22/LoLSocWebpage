_“Winning mid lane always depends on the jungler.”_

Just one of the reasons why fans choose to follow League of Legends Esports is because of this. Not how Doinb always flames Tian, but how relatable Doinb is as a person. However, different people become invested in the competitive scene of their favourite online game differently.

Some people are shoved into the competitive scene by their friends. Yilun, our current treasurer, can relate since he had ‘persuaded’ Kimberly, a Publications subcommittee and Alex, our current Vice President of Administration. But. This is not a solid reason when the hobby requires so much effort to understand and keep up to date with. So it just leads to people like Alex to “grow out of it.”

Some people push themselves into the competitive scene with a desire to not be extremely terrible at the game. So many people just want to get good at the game and they consider pro play to be their best bet. These expectations of learning opportunities are sometimes crushed by the fact that some leagues are always 10 patches behind, copy from popular solo queue builds or sometimes, their strategies require coordinate team play! Even though esports isn’t always one of the most reliable sources for the latest ways to climb, some of the greatest plays are there.

Take Ryze for example. Across all seasons of esports, he has the highest presence at 46%. You can check a few of his stats for all time esports and Season 9 so far in the professional scene and in solo queue.

Some people taste the entertainment of the competitive scene and choose to stay because of the fiestas, siestas or even the “don’t worry guys we scale” team compositions. Some things on the screen like Tahm Kench can be so good or so bad. You could watch [Ming save Uzi with a fifth of his HP from a Zoe combo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccnTVayy1X8) or you could watch [Smoothie spit out Zven with one HP into the enemy team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSqJlVzzlv4). Both occasions, you’ll definitely want to know more. Do they Alistar headbutt the fed top laner into their entire team? Or do they land a five man Headbutt Pulverise? One can only stay tuned to truly find out. Spoiler. Everyone does both.

Some people invest themselves too much into an [emotional video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3O-TQQQFwY) and feel obligated to stay. Or maybe it’s a [mic check](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VLtYLH5OZE&t=13s) that will draw them in. Or you might be a bandwagon like Kenzo, our publications director, who likes the popular teams. The propaganda that Riot or Tencent create to entice people into the esports scene draw a different group outside of the people who accidentally click on the Twitch stream come Worlds. There are two extremities to this different group - stalker fans and the fans who will support their favourite player till the inevitable _r-word_.

I actually got drawn into the professional scene - specifically LPL - because of the linked mic check above. It showcased their second international win after Rift Rivals 2017 and before MSI, Rift Rivals and Worlds in 2018. Since I only started watching February last year, I listened to the narratives of the past year while watching how the players who were fabled to have failed grow stronger. The highlight of my esports year was watching JackeyLove grow. From cracking under pressure in their Spring Semi Finals match against RNG which essentially lost them the series. To beating KT by flashing in at the right time. To lifting the World Championship trophy. All in his debut year.

It doesn’t matter whether you’re Challenger or Iron, whether you’re a 4fun player or you play to flex on your friends, everyone has their own place in esports. It could be the Twitch Chat, the LoLSoc Esports discussion channel or a silent place where you squeal to yourself when Theshy dodges like the wind.

All fans are included and Scout agrees:

_“I want to sincerely thank all the fans who support us.”_
